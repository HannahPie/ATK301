Design Streak Studio <br> <br>

<b>CONCEPT</b> <br>

For the upcoming release of Design Streak Studio's 40th Anniversary book, we brainstormed as a studio to come up with
twelve words describing Design Streak, each beginning with the letters <br> D, E, S, I, G, N, S, T, R, E, A, and K.
I chose the letter E and to use the word Empathy. Empathy is something we put into practice abundantly as designers
while working with fellow studiomates, clients, research, and venues. We always strive to show
empathy when working with others to fulfill an understanding of subject matter and create authentic designs.
Through designing with empathy, we can learn to carry this trait through other aspects of our lives.<br> <br>
The most empathetic among us are children. They feel deeply as they grasp for an understanding of the world.
The focus of this piece is childlike innocence. It provides the viewer with a lens of innocence through
the use of bright colors and a whimsical illustration style. The concept of "putting ourselves in another's shoes"
is told quite literally through the depiction of people wearing two different shoes. Though wearing two different<br>
shoes may be uncomfortable, the result is a pleasing, balanced composition that alludes to the peace empathy <br>
can create.
