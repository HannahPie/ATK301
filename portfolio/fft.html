Food For Thought Exhibition </br> </br>

<b>CONCEPT</b> </br>

This poster was designed for the exhibition <i>Food For Thought</i>. This exhibition would
showcase posters that illustrate the designers' cultural identity and heritage through informational posters centered
around food. The designers were asked to choose a food that felt nostalgic and personal to them in terms of
cultural identity. Then, they researched the food, its journey to their country of origin, and how it culturally
impacted the region. The resulting informational posters were displayed in Milner Library. </br>

This poster is meant to represent how food can play a major role in identity. To play off of the exhibition's title,
we chose to show food traveling through the brain through neurons. All of the food that would be showcased in the exhibition is illustrated
in this poster. The lines move in an organic way, representing the fluidity of identity. When thinking about color,
we wanted to choose colors that reminded the viewer of food in a general way.
Red, orange, and green are the most commonly found colors in food. We wanted the text to feel tangible, as if the
viewer could interact with and bite it through their eyes. This is why we chose text with rounded edges, and a sort of
visual buoyancy. The text becomes one with the image as the flowing lines interact with the letterforms, flowing
and weaving throughout them.
