<b>CONCEPT</b> </br>
This shirt was created for the alumni of Gamma Phi Circus at Illinois State University. Because this shirt would
be a keepsake for alumni of the group, I took into account the feeling of nostalgia. Nostalgia looks to the past
and creates beautiful images in the mind based on memory and feeling. I looked to retro circus design and Victorian
type for inspiration to create a typographic image. The fluidity of thoughts and memory are illustrated through
the flowing lines and shapes throughout the piece. The baseline of type curves upward to represent this
fluidity, and also to depict the positivity of nostalgic thoughts and how they can propel us to create a better
future. The swirls and cascading circles call to mind the motion of circus routines that combine elements of
dance and gymnastics to create a visually dynamic performance. A navy blue T-shirt serves to remind the viewer of
looking at the night sky in fond rememberence of the past, and seeing memories play out in the white glowing stars above.
