	<img src="picofme.png" alt=Picture of Myself width=300px>
 <p> I am currently a senior Graphic Design student studying at Illinois State University, graduating in May of 2020.
During my time as an undergrad, I  have gained valuable design knowledge working for Design Streak Studio, University
 Marketing and Communications, and serving as a Teaching Assistant for a design class at Shanghai Normal University
 in Shanghai, China. </br> </br>
I can credit my sister Regina, who lives with developmental disabilities, for the lessons she has taught me to make
me who I am today. Iâ€™m currently working on writing and designing a book dedicated to her.</br> </br> <span class="resume"><a target="_blank" href="Hannah Piemonte Resume.pdf">Resume</a></span> </p></br> </br>
