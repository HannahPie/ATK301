<b>CONCEPT</b> </br>
Ciclo Dell Amore Ristorante is a restaurant based in Italy. Our mission is to provide young adults with disabilities
the resources, experience, and constructive professional development they need to obtain a role in the
workplace. We hope that through inclusion and understanding, everyone can have the chance to both play a role and
succeed in the workplace. </br> </br>
We use a warm red as our primary color to bring a sense of home to our restaurant's ambiance. We want this sense
of home to both to welcome our customers and make our staff feel a sense of belonging. Our logo uses a tall, sans-
serif font that stands proudly and serves as a symbol of professionalism and confidence. To illustrate the word
"Amore", a handwritten type is used to demonstrate the humanity of love, and the tender care put into our program
to ensure our members receive the most beneficial experience. Our "Ciclo Dell Amore" (Cycle of Love) starts with the
love we show our members as we help them succeed, and ends with happy and full customers who gather here for the
shared experience of love for one another.
