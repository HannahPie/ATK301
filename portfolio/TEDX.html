<p> <b>CLIENT</b> <br>

TED X <br> <br>

<b>CONCEPT</b> <br>

We were presented with the opportunity to design a TED Talk event in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois. From posters to animations to installations, we designed each detail of the event and gained valuable experience along the way.

The theme for the event was titled “Authentic”. When considering this theme, we thought about Bloomington-Normal and the authentic characteristics of the community. “Authentic” and “normal” are contrasting words, yet also compliment each other well. Bloomington-Normal has an authentic history that combines aspects of farming and family life, college life, and modern art. Authenticity relates to life, as everyone has a different path in life that is unique to them. We illustrated this through the complex sets of lines that flow throughout the pieces and interact in different ways. The red dots we use act as markers representing various landmarks of Bloomington-Normal. As a result, the eye flows throughout the piece, giving the viewer a similar experience to reading a map. We also related the red circles to TED X because of the red dot the keynote speakers stand on while speaking. Overall, the pieces demonstrate authenticity by depicting different, authentic lives coming together in a shared experience at TED X Normal.
