<b>CONCEPT</b> </br>

I have always been interested in the Piemonte region of Italy because I share a name with the region.
My research for this informational poster included studying how family vineyard owners go through the process
of making wine, and how they distribute it to customers across Italy and throughout the world. Through this research,
 I discovered how many dynamics of my family seem derived from the way family vineyard owners run their livelihood.
 For these families, vineyards are passed down through generations and everyone participates in producing the wine.
 Similarly, my family works to preserve traditions and puts a strong emphasis on family bonds and everyone doing
 their part to sustain these bonds.
The poster is divided up into four different grapes that produce different types of wines that are most prevalent in
Piemonte, Italy. I explain a bit about the taste, production, and popularity for each type of grape. I chose to draw most
elements of my piece in a painterly style to give my poster a warm, handmade, and artisanal feel
in relation to the traditional aspects of wine-making in Piemonte. My piece flows organically to allow the
viewerâ€™s eye to flow through the piece much like a grape vine flows through a vineyard. </br> </br>
