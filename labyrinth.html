Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) </br> </br>

<b>CONCEPT</b> </br>

Labyrinth Made Goods is a non-for-profit organization that is founded under YWCA Labyrinth Outreach Services to
Women. This sector of YWCA provides services to help formerly incarcerated women reintegrate into society.
The goal of Labyrinth Made Goods is to establish a place of work for these women to gain professional
experience and to help their reintegration process. Their first product is a hand-poured candle. </br></br>
The logo uses the typeface "Arkhip", a sans serif typeface that is clean and polished and modified to portray a unique,
handmade flair. Four seasons of candles, along with a specialty Serenity candle, were designed. Each season is
designated its own color, each radiating a sense of warmth and brightness that illustrates the kindness which
Labyrinth Made Goods is founded upon. Along with a color, each season posesses a unique illustration drawn with
detail in a botanical style, highlighting the handmade process of creating the candles. Overall, each candle
exhudes a sense of modern professionalism and classic sophistication that gives Labyrinth Made Goods a professional
groundwork to work upon while also capturing their warm, accepting personality as a business.
